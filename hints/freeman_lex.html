            Catch an idea 💡! This infinite sequence starts with nine single-digit numbers, followed by ninety two-digit numbers, followed by nine hundred three-digit numbers, and so on. Once you reach the block of k-digit numbers that contains the position n, the digit in that position is best determined with integer arithmetic, perhaps aided by an <code>str</code> conversion for access to digit positions.
